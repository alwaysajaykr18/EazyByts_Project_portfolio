A personal portfolio is a custom-built website that highlights an individual's professional skills, projects, and accomplishments. It is created using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactive features. This combination allows for a visually appealing and user-friendly presentation of the individual's work.
